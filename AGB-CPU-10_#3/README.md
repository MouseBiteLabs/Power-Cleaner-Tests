# AGB-CPU-10 (#3) Results

This one is actually a combination of #1 and #2. It is the same as #1, but I swapped the audio amplifier chip from #2 onto it and removed C45, C46, and C47 (as seems to be done with the BH amp according to the Game Boy Hardware Database).

- CPU Revision: CPU AGB A
- SRAM: Fujitsu MB82D12160-10FN
- Crystal: Kinseki
- PMIC: 9750B
- Amp: BH7835AFS
- LCD bias chip not included (32-pin)

Since GitHub does not allow for embedding .wav files, I have converted them to MP4 for convenient listening. Source recordings are provided above, as well as an Audacity project including all of the recordings for further analysis.

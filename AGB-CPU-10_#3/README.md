# AGB-CPU-10 (#3) Results

This one is actually a combination of #1 and #2. It is the same as #1, but I swapped the audio amplifier chip from #2 onto it and removed C45, C46, and C47 (as seems to be done with the BH amp according to the Game Boy Hardware Database).

Since GitHub does not allow for embedding .wav files, I have converted them to MP4 for convenient listening. Source recordings are provided above, as well as an Audacity project including all of the recordings for further analysis.
